           <h1>TelcoNG overview</h1>
           <p>With consumers constantly on the lookout for the next best offer, 
          service providers are challenged to stay profitable while meeting
           customer demand. To do this, service providers need a next-generation
            BSS/OSS platform that enhances their ability to maintain customer 
            satisfaction, drive new revenue, and increase operational efficiency.
           To satisfy today’s customers, it is critical for service providers to offer a 
           consistent and unified multi-channel experience by providing advanced capabilities 
           and enhanced self service, as well as access to real-time information regarding 
           usage, services, and charges. Market saturation and increased competition have 
           also made it imperative for service providers to explore new revenue opportunities, 
           including the launch of innovative consumer services, expansion into the B2B and 
           Network sharing space, and the introduction of quad-play bundles. Finally, outsid
          forces have also made it critical for service providers to look inward at the cost
          of doing business and the optimization of their infrastructure and operations. 
          By consolidating their applications onto a single platform, service providers
          can reduce integration and support costs.</p>
